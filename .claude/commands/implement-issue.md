# Implement GitHub Issue #$ARGUMENTS

Please implement issue #$ARGUMENTS from the thinkube repository following this strict process:

## Implementation Process Checklist

1. **Issue Analysis**
   - [ ] Read the GitHub issue #$ARGUMENTS completely
   - [ ] Identify all reference implementation URLs mentioned in the issue
   - [ ] List the issue requirements explicitly

2. **Reference Review**
   - [ ] Download/fetch all reference files from provided URLs
   - [ ] Analyze the reference implementation line-by-line
   - [ ] Document what features ARE in the reference
   - [ ] Document what features ARE NOT in the reference (to avoid adding them)

3. **Implementation**
   - [ ] Create implementation matching the reference exactly
   - [ ] Do not add features not present in the reference
   - [ ] Flag any necessary deviations with justification
   - [ ] Compare your implementation with the reference (like a diff)

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test the implementation as specified
   - [ ] Fix any issues while maintaining reference compliance
   - [ ] Verify all tests pass

5. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update any relevant documentation
   - [ ] Note the PR number if creating one

## IMPORTANT RULES
- Always explicitly state: "Checking reference from [URL]"
- Always list: "Reference includes: [features]" and "Reference excludes: [features]"
- Never add functionality not in the reference without explicit discussion
- If you think something is missing, ask: "Reference doesn't include X, should I add it?"
