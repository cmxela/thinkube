## Key Installer Features Implemented

### 1. Correct Workflow Sequence
The installer now follows the actual Thinkube deployment process:
1. Sudo Password Collection â†’ 2. Requirements Check â†’ 3. Server Discovery
4. SSH Setup â†’ 5. Hardware Detection â†’ 6. VM Planning â†’ 7. Role Assignment â†’ 8. Deploy

### 2. SSH Authentication
- Uses existing SSH credentials (same user/password as installer machine)
- No longer asks for new SSH credentials
- Automatically sets up passwordless SSH between servers

### 3. Backend API Improvements
- All endpoints standardized to use `/api` prefix
- WebSocket for real-time installation progress
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Cloudflare domain verification endpoint

### 4. Frontend Components
- SudoPassword.vue - Dedicated sudo password collection
- ServerDiscovery.vue - Network discovery with optional test mode
- SSHSetup.vue - Verifies SSH connectivity using existing credentials
- HardwareDetection.vue - GPU detection and passthrough planning
- VMPlanning.vue - LXD VM resource allocation
- RoleAssignment.vue - Kubernetes node role assignment
- Deploy.vue - Actual deployment with progress tracking

## Running the Installer

### Development Mode
```bash
cd ~/thinkube/installer
./test-dev.sh
```
This starts both backend (port 8000) and frontend (port 5173) in development mode.

### Building for Production
```bash
cd ~/thinkube/installer
./scripts/build-all.sh
```
This creates:
- `build/thinkube-installer-linux-x64.deb`
- `build/thinkube-installer-linux-x64.AppImage`

## Important Technical Details

### 1. Fish Shell Compatibility
The installer now handles fish shell by creating an npm wrapper script that ensures nvm is loaded properly.

### 2. SUDO_ASKPASS Mechanism
The backend uses a custom askpass script to handle sudo operations with the user-provided password.

### 3. Installation Detection
The installer now properly checks for:
- LXD VMs (tkc, tkw1, bcn1)
- MicroK8s installation
- Kubernetes namespaces
Instead of just checking for source code directory.

### 4. Test Mode
Server discovery and several other components support a test mode for development without actual network operations.

## Next Steps for Development

### 1. Complete Deployment Testing
- Test the full deployment process end-to-end
- Verify all ansible playbooks are called correctly
- Ensure progress tracking works throughout

### 2. Error Recovery
- Implement rollback for each deployment stage
- Add ability to resume from failed steps
- Better error messages for common issues

### 3. Post-Installation
- Add post-installation configuration UI
- Service health checks
- Initial user setup wizard

### 4. Documentation Site
- Complete the service-specific documentation
- Add tutorials for common workflows
- Add troubleshooting guides

### 5. Awareness Campaign
- Start writing the first LinkedIn articles
- Create supporting graphics using the Thinkube icons
- Plan the publication schedule

## Known Issues to Address

1. The installer needs proper testing on Ubuntu 24.04 (currently developed on Raspberry Pi OS)
2. GPU detection might need adjustments for different hardware configurations
3. The VM resource allocation algorithm could be more sophisticated
4. Need to add validation for Cloudflare API token permissions

## Development Environment Setup

When you arrive in Barcelona:

1. **Pull Latest Changes**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/thinkube && git pull
   cd ~/thinkube/thinkube.org && git pull
   cd ~/thinkube/thinkube-awareness && git pull
   ```

2. **Install Development Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/thinkube/installer/backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   
   cd ../electron
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/thinkube/installer
   ./test-dev.sh
   ```

## Contact for Questions

If you need to reference the work done or have questions about implementation details, all code is well-documented with comments marked with ðŸ¤– for AI-assisted sections.

The main workflow is documented in `/installer/WORKFLOW_PLAN.md` which provides a detailed explanation of each step in the deployment process.
