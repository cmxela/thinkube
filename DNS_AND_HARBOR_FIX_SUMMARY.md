# DNS Resolution and Harbor Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. DNS Resolution Issue

**Problem:** 
- DNS resolution for subdomains like `auth.thinkube.com` was failing
- Error: "Name or service not known" when trying to access auth.thinkube.com
- This was affecting Keycloak deployment which is integrated with Harbor

**Root Cause:**
- Discovered conflicting DNS configurations in the Thinkube platform
- The file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns.conf` with `Domains=~.` directive was overriding CoreDNS settings
- This was causing all domains to go to Google DNS (8.8.8.8) instead of using proper routing
- The conflict was between early VM setup (dns.conf) and later CoreDNS configuration

**Solution:**
- Modified the CoreDNS node configuration playbook (`15_configure_node_dns.yaml`)
- Added tasks to remove the conflicting dns.conf file
- Ensured proper DNS forwarding for wildcard domains

**Testing:**
- Enhanced the DNS testing playbook (`18_test.yaml`)
- Added tests for specific service domains
- Added checks for conflicting DNS configurations
- Added more detailed diagnostics for DNS precedence issues

### 2. Harbor Image Mirroring

**Problem:**
- Harbor deployment was working but image mirroring functionality wasn't working properly
- The implementation didn't fully match the reference playbook functionality
- Robot account didn't have proper permissions to push to the library project

**Root Cause:**
- The migration from the reference playbook missed some critical elements:
  1. The image_mirror role wasn't properly implemented
  2. The robot account permissions were incomplete (missing library project access)
  3. The authentication setup was not correctly implemented

**Solution:**
1. Created proper implementation of the image_mirror role in ansible/roles/container_deployment/image_mirror
2. Updated robot account creation in 15_configure_thinkube.yaml to include permissions for library project
3. Modified 17_mirror_public_images.yaml to use the proper role and handle authentication correctly

## Lessons Learned

1. **DNS Configuration Precedence**: 
   - Discovered the importance of understanding DNS precedence in systemd-resolved
   - Learned how early VM-level configurations can override later K8s-level setups
   - Demonstrated proper layering of DNS configurations 

2. **Reference Implementation Reuse**:
   - When migrating from a reference codebase, roles and dependencies must be fully analyzed
   - Important to maintain 100% of functionality from reference implementations
   - Don't reimagine solutions that already work in the reference code

3. **Role-Based Organization**:
   - Ansible roles provide reusable, modular components that make maintenance easier
   - Standard locations for roles are important for discoverability and function
   - Following Ansible best practices for role structure pays off

4. **Harbor Security Model**:
   - Harbor uses a complex permission model with projects and robot accounts
   - System-level robot accounts need explicit permissions for each project
   - The library project is special and requires its own permission entries

## Current State

The fix branch has successfully addressed both the DNS resolution issue and the Harbor image mirroring functionality:

1. **Components Fixed:**
   - CoreDNS configuration (DNS resolution)
   - Harbor deployment and OIDC integration 
   - Harbor robot account permissions
   - Harbor image mirroring

2. **Playbooks Modified:**
   - `ansible/40_thinkube/core/infrastructure/coredns/15_configure_node_dns.yaml`
   - `ansible/40_thinkube/core/infrastructure/coredns/18_test.yaml`
   - `ansible/40_thinkube/core/harbor/15_configure_thinkube.yaml`
   - `ansible/40_thinkube/core/harbor/17_mirror_public_images.yaml`

3. **Roles Created:**
   - `ansible/roles/container_deployment/image_mirror/`

4. **Working Functionality:**
   - DNS resolution for all subdomains (*.thinkube.com)
   - Keycloak deployment and access via auth.thinkube.com
   - Harbor deployment and access via registry.thinkube.com
   - Harbor OIDC integration with Keycloak
   - Robot account creation with proper permissions
   - Image mirroring from public registries to local Harbor

## Next Steps

1. **Complete PR and Merge:**
   - Create a detailed PR description summarizing the changes
   - Highlight the DNS resolution fix and the Harbor image mirroring fix
   - Mention the lessons learned 

2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Update DNS architecture documentation with the resolution of the conflict
   - Document the Harbor deployment and image mirroring setup

3. **Future Considerations:**
   - Add more comprehensive testing for DNS edge cases
   - Monitor for potential DNS conflicts in future VM/LXD setup
   - Consider abstracting the robot account permission management into a role
   - Add more test cases for Harbor functionality

This fix sets the foundation for the rest of the infrastructure deployment, particularly for the components that rely on proper DNS resolution and container image availability.
