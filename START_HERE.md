# START HERE: Thinkube Implementation Plan (v0.0.1)

This document serves as the master task list for implementing the Thinkube architecture according to our AI-AD methodology. It provides a sequential checklist to ensure consistent progress even if development sessions are interrupted or restarted.

## How to Use This Document

1. At the start of each development session, review this document first
2. Check the status of each task ([ ] = pending, [x] = completed)
3. Continue work on the next incomplete task
4. Update task status as work progresses
5. Document lessons learned after each phase

## Updating Task Status

To update a task's status, use the provided script:

```bash
# Mark a task as complete (replace 42 with the line number of the task)
python3 scripts/update_task_status.py 42 complete

# Mark a task as pending
python3 scripts/update_task_status.py 42 pending

# Always commit changes to maintain progress
git add START_HERE.md
git commit -m "[Project] Update task progress in START_HERE.md"
git push
```

This helps maintain accurate progress tracking between development sessions and ensures changes are preserved in the repository.
