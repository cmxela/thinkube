# START HERE: Thinkube Implementation Plan (v0.0.2)

This document serves as the master task list for implementing the Thinkube architecture according to our AI-AD methodology. It provides a sequential checklist to ensure consistent progress even if development sessions are interrupted or restarted.

## How to Use This Document

1. At the start of each development session, review this document first
2. Check the status of each task ([ ] = pending, [x] = completed)
3. Continue work on the next incomplete task
4. Update task status as work progresses
5. Document lessons learned after each phase

## Updating Task Status

To update a task's status, use the provided script:

```bash
# Mark a task as complete (replace 42 with the line number of the task)
python3 scripts/update_task_status.py 42 complete

# Mark a task as pending
python3 scripts/update_task_status.py 42 pending

# Always commit changes to maintain progress
git add START_HERE.md
git commit -m "[Project] Update task progress in START_HERE.md"
git push
```

This helps maintain accurate progress tracking between development sessions and ensures changes are preserved in the repository.

## Previous Milestones

- [x] **Milestone 1 (v0.0.1):** Infrastructure & Virtualization Layer - Completed
  - Initial repository setup, baremetal infrastructure, LXD virtualization, and networking
  - See [CLAUDE_MILESTONE1.md](/CLAUDE_MILESTONE1.md) for details

## Phase 5: Core Services (40_thinkube) - Milestone 2

> Note: Phase 5 focuses on migrating thinkube-core functionality and establishing the core platform services.
> 
> **Issue Tracking**: Each component requirement has a corresponding GitHub issue. Tasks are linked to issues using [CORE-XXX] or [OPT-XXX] format.
> 
> All functional/implementation tasks are tracked in the GitHub issues. This document only tracks development process tasks.
