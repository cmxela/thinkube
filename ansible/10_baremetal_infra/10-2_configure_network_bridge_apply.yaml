# 10-2_configure_network_bridge_apply.yaml - Apply network bridge configuration
#
# Purpose:
#   Applies the network bridge configuration that was prepared.
#   CRITICAL: This will likely disrupt SSH connectivity temporarily.
#
# Run with: 
#   ansible-playbook -i inventory/inventory.yaml ansible/10_baremetal_infra/10-2_configure_network_bridge_apply.yaml
#   Or with helper script:
#   ./scripts/run_ansible.sh ansible/10_baremetal_infra/10-2_configure_network_bridge_apply.yaml

          This playbook WILL APPLY the network bridge configuration and 
          WILL DISRUPT your SSH connection temporarily.
          
          Make sure you have completed the preparation step first by running:
          ./scripts/run_ansible.sh ansible/10_baremetal_infra/10-1_configure_network_bridge_prepare.yaml
          
          After the network configuration is applied and your connection is
          reestablished, run the test playbook to verify:
          ./scripts/run_ansible.sh ansible/10_baremetal_infra/18_test_network_bridge.yaml

          REQUIRED ACTION:

          The next step will reconfigure the network on {{ inventory_hostname }}.
          This will disrupt your SSH connection temporarily.
          
          BEFORE PROCEEDING:
            ‚úì Make sure you have physical access to the machines in case of issues
            ‚úì Network configuration has been backed up in /tmp/netplan_backup_*
            ‚úì If something goes wrong, you can restore using the backup files
          
          Press ENTER to continue or Ctrl+C to abort
    
    # Activate the prepared configuration
    - name: Move prepared configuration to active location
      ansible.builtin.command: mv /etc/netplan/01-thinkube-config.yaml.prepared /etc/netplan/01-thinkube-config.yaml

      poll: 0    # Don't wait for completion
      
    # Cannot reliably execute any more tasks after network reconfiguration
    # since the connection will be disrupted. The message about running
    # the test playbook is included in the intro message instead.
