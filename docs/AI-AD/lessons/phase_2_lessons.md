# Phase 2: Baremetal Infrastructure Lessons

## Overview

This document captures lessons learned during the implementation of Phase 2 (Baremetal Infrastructure), which focused on network bridge configuration for VM connectivity.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Network Configuration Safety
- Root cause: Network configuration changes can disrupt SSH connectivity
- Impact: Risk of losing access to remote systems during bridge configuration
- Solution: Split the configuration process into prepare, apply, and verify stages
- Prevention: Always have a recovery plan ready before making network changes

### Challenge 2: Source Control Management
- Root cause: Helper scripts were created but not tracked in git
- Impact: Lost the run_ansible.sh helper script between sessions
- Solution: Recreated the script and immediately committed it to the repository
- Prevention: Always verify that there are no stashed or uncommitted files before creating PRs

### Challenge 3: Session Continuity
- Root cause: Lack of proper documentation for environment setup between sessions
- Impact: Difficulty in resuming work due to missing information
- Solution: Document all environment details and helper scripts with their purposes
- Prevention: Create and commit proper documentation for development environment setup

## Methodology Improvements

Based on these challenges, we've further refined our methodology:

1. **Split Critical Operations**: Divide potentially disruptive operations into separate playbooks:
   - Preparation (safe, no connectivity impact)
   - Application (potentially disruptive)
   - Verification (confirms success after disruption)

2. **Source Control Discipline**:
   - Commit all helper scripts and tools immediately after creation
   - Review for uncommitted files before creating PRs
   - Ensure all environment setup steps are documented

3. **Session Continuity**:
   - Document environment requirements clearly
   - Commit all helper scripts with clear usage instructions
   - Provide recovery procedures for potential failures

## Best Practices

New best practices identified during this phase:

1. **Split Critical Operations**: Divide network operations into prepare, apply, and verify stages
2. **Track All Tools**: Immediately commit helper scripts and tools to git
3. **Verify Before PR**: Check for stashed or uncommitted changes before creating PRs
4. **Document Environment**: Keep detailed documentation of environment setup
5. **Recovery First**: Design recovery mechanisms before implementing changes
6. **Prefer Remote Testing**: Test network changes on remote systems before local systems
7. **Backup Configurations**: Always backup configurations before making changes

## Implementation Notes

The network bridge configuration implementation followed these principles:

1. Split the playbooks into logical stages:
   - 20-1_configure_network_bridge_prepare.yaml (preparation)
   - 20-2_configure_network_bridge_apply.yaml (critical network change)
   - 20-3_configure_network_bridge_verify.yaml (verification)

2. Applied the same structure to rollback playbooks:
   - 19-1_rollback_network_bridge_prepare.yaml
   - 19-2_rollback_network_bridge_apply.yaml
   - 19-3_rollback_network_bridge_verify.yaml

3. Created comprehensive test playbook:
   - 18_test_network_bridge.yaml

This structure ensures:
- Clear separation of critical operations
- Ability to reconnect between steps
- Well-defined verification process
- Safe rollback procedures

## Testing Strategy

When testing potentially disruptive network changes:

1. Test on remote systems first, not your current system
2. Maintain connection to at least one control node
3. Have physical or out-of-band access ready as a backup
4. Document expected disconnection and reconnection process
5. Create clear recovery procedures before making changes
