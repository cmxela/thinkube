# Restart Resume Fix

## Problem
After the network configuration restart, the installer was going back to the Welcome page instead of resuming the deployment where it left off.

## Root Causes
1. The router guard was checking for old state format (`state.awaitingRestart`) which doesn't exist in the new state manager
2. The Welcome page wasn't checking for deployment in progress before proceeding
3. The session backup mechanism wasn't being properly detected

## Solution

### 1. Updated Router Guard (`router/index.js`)
- Now checks for both old and new deployment state formats
- Looks for session backup to detect restart scenarios
- Redirects to Deploy page if deployment is in progress

### 2. Updated Welcome Page (`views/Welcome.vue`)
- Added check for deployment in progress with session backup
- Immediately redirects to Deploy page if restart recovery is needed
- Prevents going through configuration screens again

### 3. Updated Deploy Page (`views/Deploy.vue`)
- Fixed session data detection (was looking for wrong key)
- Simplified restart recovery logic
- Automatically clears old state when coming from configuration

## How It Works Now

1. **Before Restart**: Session data is saved to localStorage backup
2. **After Restart**: 
   - Router guard detects deployment in progress
   - Welcome page checks for session backup
   - Redirects directly to Deploy page
   - Deploy page restores session data
   - Deployment resumes where it left off

## Testing

1. Start deployment
2. Wait for network configuration restart
3. System should automatically resume deployment after restart
4. No need to go through configuration screens again

## Key Files Modified
- `/router/index.js` - Router guard for deployment detection
- `/views/Welcome.vue` - Early detection and redirect
- `/views/Deploy.vue` - Proper session data handling
