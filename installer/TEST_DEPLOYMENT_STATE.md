# Deployment State Manager Refactor - Testing Guide

## Refactor Summary

### What Was Changed

1. **Created `deploymentState.js`** - A robust state manager that:
   - Tracks ALL playbooks (not just remaining ones)
   - Maintains separate lists of completed and failed playbooks
   - Allows retry of failed playbooks
   - Provides accurate progress tracking
   - Supports state migration from old format

2. **Updated `Deploy.vue`** to use the new state manager:
   - Modified `buildPlaybookQueue()` to return the queue array
   - Updated `onMounted` to use `deploymentState.initializeDeployment()`
   - Changed `executeNextPlaybook()` to use `deploymentState.getNextPlaybook()`
   - Updated `handlePlaybookComplete()` to use `deploymentState.markCompleted()` and `markFailed()`
   - Removed old state management code
   - Fixed duplicate function declarations

3. **Preserved all variable names** as requested:
   - `currentPlaybook`
   - `deploymentComplete`
   - `deploymentError`
   - All other existing variables remain unchanged

## Key Benefits

1. **Failed playbooks won't disappear** - They're tracked separately from completed ones
2. **True resumability** - Can resume exactly where left off, including retrying failures
3. **Better visibility** - Clear tracking of what succeeded, failed, and remains
4. **Retry capability** - Can retry failed playbooks without starting over

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Flow
- [ ] Start fresh deployment
- [ ] Verify playbooks execute in order
- [ ] Check that progress percentage updates correctly
- [ ] Verify phase indicators update properly

### Failure Handling
- [ ] Cancel a playbook during execution
- [ ] Verify it's marked as failed
- [ ] Check that retry option is available
- [ ] Confirm failed playbook can be retried

### State Persistence
- [ ] Close app mid-deployment
- [ ] Restart and verify state is restored
- [ ] Check that deployment resumes from correct position
- [ ] Verify completed playbooks aren't re-run

### Restart Handling
- [ ] Reach network bridge apply step
- [ ] Verify restart notice appears
- [ ] Complete restart process
- [ ] Confirm deployment continues after restart

### Skip-Config Mode
- [ ] Run with `--skip-config` flag
- [ ] Verify it loads existing inventory
- [ ] Check deployment starts correctly

### Clean State
- [ ] Run with `--clean-state` flag
- [ ] Verify deployment state is cleared
- [ ] Confirm inventory.yaml is preserved

## Implementation Notes

The refactor followed the user's explicit requirements:
- "Don't create new names, delete the current code and write the new code with the same name"
- "Do not leave garbage"
- Created a "strong and reliable solution" not quick fixes

All old queue-based code has been replaced with the deployment state manager while keeping the same variable names and UI behavior.
